Reviewed in Canada on July 8, 2021;2;Skin irritation;I purchased these to wear at work. My original band is made from tungsten and I wanted to change things up for safety reasons. The materials are as advertised, they look good and are comfortable after the first day or two (I ordered the black ones). One issue that I'm sure people have addressed is that they do loosen up, so go for a smaller size because in my opinion, they loosen a little more than what's advertised. I would say at least a full size, maybe even a size and a half. The second thing is, I wore the rings all the time, as most are used to doing with wedding bands. My hygiene is normal or above normal, washing hands often and showering minimum once per day and the ring was left on for all of that, also ensuring that my finger beneath the ring was clean. No cleaning products or activities changed during this period. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks, I took it off and there was a bright red band around my finger, the skin was flaking and it was itchy. I don't know if this was just me and my skin or if others have dealt with this. I'm just reporting my experience. I would happily still be wearing them but I've had the ring off for several days now and there's still a faint mark on my finger. Unfortunately, this product won't work for me. However, if it doesn't bother your skin, they are great quality and as advertised.;Skin irritation,I purchased these to wear at work. My original band is made from tungsten and I wanted to change things up for safety reasons. The materials are as advertised, they look good and are comfortable after the first day or two (I ordered the black ones). One issue that I'm sure people have addressed is that they do loosen up, so go for a smaller size because in my opinion, they loosen a little more than what's advertised. I would say at least a full size, maybe even a size and a half. The second thing is, I wore the rings all the time, as most are used to doing with wedding bands. My hygiene is normal or above normal, washing hands often and showering minimum once per day and the ring was left on for all of that, also ensuring that my finger beneath the ring was clean. No cleaning products or activities changed during this period.

B) A small part of the ring had a little blemish probably from manufacturing (see photo) but would probably not have been noticeable if the entire ring was one solid color. So another reason to buy a solid color ring next time. C) One edge of the ring looks darker than the rest of the ring (in same photo). To me, the darker color makes it look cheap and is what I dislike most about the ring. Also, I think the beveled edges makes the darker color stand out even more. Another reason to buy a solid color ring the next time without beveled edges. D) The airflow grooves really work!

Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2021;4;Good Rings, Color was â€œoffâ€;"I purchased these rings because I work with my hands a lot and have had a few close calls with my metallic wedding band getting stuck or caught.While I am pleased with these rings I was disappointed by two things. 1) As you can see from the photo, the â€œredâ€ ring is a much more vibrant red than depicted. I specifically chose this set because I liked the muted tone of the red ring, so it was a disappointment but it seemed silly to send them back over that. 2) Even though there are vent channels on the underside of the ring, the ring retained quite a bit of moisture between my finger and the ring.

My original gold ring was sized so I could remove easily - I would remove it when working with machinery or working out; I supposed some folks wear a ring they need to screw over their knuckle with oil; but if your ring isn't that tight, I think ordering the same size as your metal ring would be appropriate.The greys look nice, the black okay but I like it less. Silver looks like a kids toy. Red looks cool for not trying to look like metal. I will likely order a blue.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Love! Love!,Bought these for my husband since he is a meat cutter his wedding band would be very uncomfortable and often saw him leaving it at home so I did a lot of research and came across these. First day of wearing one of them and he loves them. It doesnâ€™t leave him pruney and itâ€™s comfortable to wear. Not only that the seller guarantees that they will send you another ring Incase the sizing was wrong, luckily I didnâ€™t have get another one since they fit perfectly but it was really nice to know that they had option out there in case that happen. 15/10 they exceeded my expectations!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2021;5;Great rings, great customer service;These rings are really nice. They have a great design and are perfect for athletes or any physical activity. If you are in between 2 sizes, I would size down because these rings are flexible and can be adjusted slightly bigger if needed. I got a ring size that was a little big, and dealt with amazing customer service. They send quick emails and I was able to order a better size without returning my previous order.
