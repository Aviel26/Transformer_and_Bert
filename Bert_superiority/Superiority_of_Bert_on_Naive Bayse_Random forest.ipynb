I specifically chose this set because I liked the muted tone of the red ring, so it was a disappointment but it seemed silly to send them back over that. 2) Even though there are vent channels on the underside of the ring, the ring retained quite a bit of moisture between my finger and the ring.

(Although the camo color isn't one of my preferable choices.) Some reviewers have complained saying the rings held in moisture and caused peeling skin--but I have not had that problem at all. I found the sizing ran very true. I measured my size using the posted technique and I also searched online for a sizing chart and printed out a page where you can place your existing ring over various sizes.
